1) The program first asks for a physical address from the user.
2) There is a check whether the entered physical address is greater than 2^32 or not. This is because we have a 32 bit address.
3) Page size equivalent to 4KBytes which is already given.
4) In Order to find out the number of pages we divide the physical address by the page size i.e 4096.
5) In Order to find out starting address of a physical page we implicit convert the multiple of pages and pagesize to hex.
6) Offset is calculated by multiplying remainder by pagesize.

Characteristic Common:
	The starting address depends on the number of pages in the program. The starting address is actually hexadecimal conversion of number of pages. 
	For e.g, if physical address is 19986=>
			Number of Pages = 4
			Starting Address = 0x4000
		 if physical address is 47892932
			Nummber of Pages = 11692
			Starting Address = 0x2dac000
	Also the starting address of each physical address is divisible by 4.
